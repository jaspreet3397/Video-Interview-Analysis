The python libraries required to run the code is there
in the requirements.txt file.

The emotion recognition model accuracy is about 63%. You
can use my pretrained models with weights or build a new 
model from scratch.

The main.py file has the main script. The paths in the file
are hard coded so make sure you edit them before running the
script.

You might also need ffmped to convert the video to audio file.
Here is the link https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/ 
Download and place in C: drive.

You will need to install Nvidea CUDA 11.0+

The model is in Emotion_Recognition_Model.ipynb.
